# instead so this can't silently drift again with a column-width change.

# running directly on the host (as the CI runner now does) fails with
# "Could not resolve host". The documented 10.0.100.x addresses per
# container are also not load-bearing: real containers come up on
# whatever the bridge's DHCP hands out, which drifts across replaces. Ask
# Incus directly instead of assuming either.
